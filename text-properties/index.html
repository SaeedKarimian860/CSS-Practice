    <h1>Video Game Development</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Video game development (sometimes shortened to gamedev) is the process of
      creating a video game. It is a multidisciplinary practice, involving
      <a href="nowhere">programming</a>, design, art, audio, user interface, and writing. Each of
      those may be made up of more specialized skills; art includes 3D modeling
      of objects, character modeling, animation, visual effects, and so on.
      Development is supported by project management, production, and quality
      assurance. Teams can be many hundreds of people, a small group, or even a
      single person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Development of commercial video games is normally funded by a publisher
      and can take two to five years to reach completion. Game creation by
      small, self-funded teams is called independent development. The technology
      in a game may be written from scratch or use proprietary software specific
      to one company. As development has become more complex, it has become
      common for companies and independent developers alike to use off-the-shelf
      "engines" such as Unity or Unreal Engine.[1]

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Games are produced through the software development process.[2] Games are
      developed as a creative outlet[3] and to generate profit.[4] Game making
      is considered both art and science.[5][6] Development is normally funded
      by a publisher.[7] Well-made games bring profit more readily.[5] However,
      it is important to estimate a game's financial requirements,[8] such as
      development costs of individual features.[9] Failing to provide clear
      implications of game's expectations may result in exceeding allocated
      budget.[8] In fact, the majority of commercial games do not produce
      profit.[10][11][12] Most developers cannot afford to change their
      development schedule midway, and require estimating their capabilities
      with available resources before production.[13]

    <h2>Development Process</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Pre-production</h3>
    <p>
      Pre-production[126] or design phase[71] is a planning phase of the project
      focused on idea and concept development and production of initial design
      documents.[125][127][128][129] The goal of concept development is to
      produce clear and easy to understand documentation,[125][130] which
      describes all the tasks, schedules and estimates for the development
      team.[131] The suite of documents produced in this phase is called
      production plan.[132] This phase is usually not funded by a
      publisher,[125] however good publishers may require developers to produce
      plans during pre-production.[131]
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept documentation can be separated into three stages or
      documentsâ€”high concept, pitch and concept;[124][133] however, there is no
      industry standard naming convention, for example, both Bethke (2003) and
      Bates (2004) refer to pitch document as "game proposal",[126][131] yet
      Moore, Novak (2010) refers to concept document as "game proposal".[124]The
      late stage of pre-production may also be referred to as proof of
      concept,[126] or technical review[124] when more detailed game documents
      are produced.Publishers have started to expect broader game proposals even
      featuring playable prototypes.[1]
    </p>
    <h3>Production</h3>
    <p>
      Production is the main stage of development, when assets and source code
      for the game are produced.[145]
    </p>
    <p>
      Mainstream production is usually defined as the period of time when the
      project is fully staffed.[citation needed] Programmers write new source
      code, artists develop game assets, such as, sprites or 3D models. Sound
      engineers develop sound effects and composers develop music for the game.
      Level designers create levels, and writers write dialogue for cutscenes
      and NPCs.[original research?] Game designers continue to develop the
      game's design throughout production.
